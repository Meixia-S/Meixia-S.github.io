    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> 
     I am 21 year old, third year student living in Boston. I orginally am from Illinois in 
     the ChicagoLand area and have lived there most of my life. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

    <h3> Life Synopsis</h3>
    <p>
     I was born in Hunan China and adopted at the age of three and a half. 
     Due to speaking some chinese as a child my parents where keen on 
     making sure I did not loose that skill. At 21 years old now my listening 
     comprehension is near fulent with my other three skills leaving a bit to
     be desired as I have had little practice since high school. Growing up I
     was fortunate to be exposed to many different activies from art classes 
     to chinese dancing to tennis lessons. These experince taught me how to 
     learn different types of skills and knowing how I learn best as an 
     individual. At a young age I was diagnosed with OCD and dyslexia. These
     two issues took years to overcome. With a couple years of theropy and four
     years in the Willison program, I was able to mostly overcome both set backs.
     I can contribute the early action to my mother who was very attentive and 
     saw my obessive behavior as a child. 
     <br> <br>
     At age 12 my mother passed away from heart cancer. This had a huge impact 
     on my life as she was my main care taker. Soon after her passing my father 
     started a six year traveling mania. Every break I had during middle school 
     and high school, he would take me on eye opening vacations where we travled 
     the world. Seeing what other people live through and what their normal life 
     routine are made me truly value the life I had. During this time I was drawn
     to Japanese animation to the point it led me to taking Japanese language classes
     at the local community college, College Of DuPage. I made decent progress during 
     that one semester and can say that learning languages is a low-key hobby of 
     mine but it is challenging to self teach a language with no one to practice with. 
     <br> <br>
     After graduating high school with honors I moved to Boston to attend Simmons 
     University. I originally chose the school as I thought an all women learning 
     envirnment would be the best way to start my higher education career due to the
     fact computer science industry is a male dominated field. Being with women may
     have allowed me to feel more comfortable and let me be more active in the classes.
     After the first year this turned out not to be the case so I took the down time 
     during COVID-19 to sit down and ask myself what I wanted my future to look like. 
     I realized that sitting down and coding all day was as desireable of a goal then 
     orginally thought- I wanted more varity and opportunity. The idea of a dual major 
     popped in my head. With that in mind I searched for a school in the area that 
     offered that type of schooling. That is when I stumbled upon Northeastern University. 
     It was a perfect match for both location and academic excellence so I applied 
     immediately and was elated to be accepted as a transfer student. I am now in the 
     third year and have really enjoyed my time at the university. Taking the 
     foundational courses it became clear that front ended jobs would be a better fit 
     for me since seeing the direct impact of my code if a more fulfilling process. 
     I am a more visual learner, so this also makes a better fit for me as a student. 
     This brings things up to present day. I look forward to whatever opportunities 
     that come my way and to make the most of those experinces.

    <h3> Career Aspirations </h3>
    <p> 
     There is still so many aspects of the world I have no idea about have little
     knowledge of. It makes it hard to know exactly what I want and impossible to 
     know how my life will play out. Knowing this, I can say that I am open minded
     about this process. Being a dual major student there are many opportunities 
     and routes for me. Working on front end deveopment would be an amazing start
     as I have always wanted a more techical job. To be apart of a larger project
     that many customers or business use is a role I would love to be apart of. If
     that doesn't work out I still am interested in fintech as it combines technology 
     and finance (my concentration). Being able to use my other half of my major, 
     business administration is also a great opportunity. Jobs such as: .... . 
     Ideally I would love to be able use both my majors in whatever position I am in.
     Not only would this be a rare case of actually getting a job related to what I
     went to school for, it could be a role where I still need some technical skill  
     while simultaneously having a more administrative role.

   <div class= "passions">
    <h3> Passions </h3>
    <p> 
     As I have entered the young adult stage of my life there where two distinct 
     topics that really drew my attention. The first being web development/design 
     and the second one being evolution. I will go into more detail as to what 
     excatly makes those two very different interest become my passion. 
     <br> <br>
     I hope the layout and small details of this website (when finished) 
     can in part show that web development is something I am truly passionate 
     about.
     <br> <br>
     Both my grandmother and mother have been very artisitic and distilled 
     it's value in me when I was younger. At that time the more traditional 
     way of creating art never appealed to me. It was almost a bit too open 
     ended for me and if I made mistake, it often meant I would have to start 
     over as arcylic paint is not the most forgiving medium. Web design on the 
     other hand is quite the oppsite. One can simply remove a line of code or 
     go back to an older version of the site to undo any mistakes. It is a more 
     forgiving process in that aspect. It also mixes coding into the mix that 
     more modern art form. Being in my early 20s this is an undienable plus 
     since it makes me feel like my work can be appercaited by my peers and 
     has real utility to it. 
     <br> <br>
     The second passion of mine is less techinally driven interest. Taking 
     ecology and biology classes in high school made me look at the natrual 
     world with a more critical eye. Instead of thinking an animal looked 
     odd or bazzar, I started to wonder why they looked the way they did 
     and if it was the environment or its place in the food chain. As I got 
     older this curisoity turned to why humans are the way we are and our 
     evolutionary journey and its place in the current time period. As more 
     information closly gets uncovered and piece of our past has been put 
     together it really presents an intriguing story of where we came from as 
     a speicies. Learning about this kind of science has really helped me put 
     things into perspective and feel more connected with the world. I know 
     these are quite __ statements but I think someone's passion/hobby should 
     help people feel more present and connected to their spot in the world and 
     for me, learning about "life's" past does that for me. On a lighter note 
     if you ever learn more about bugs, you'll find that they truly are the 
     aliens that roam along side us!
