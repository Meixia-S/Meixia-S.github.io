    <h3> Passions </h3>
    <p> 
     As I have entered the young adult stage of my life there where two 
     distinct topics that really drew my attention. The first being web 
     development/design and the second one being evolution. I will go into
     more detail as to what excatly makes those two very different interest 
     become my passion. 
     <br> <br>
     I hope the layout and small details of this website (when finished) can 
     in part show that web development is something I am truly passionate about.
     <br> <br>
     Both my grandmother and mother have been very artisitic and distilled it's 
     value in me when I was younger. At that time the more traditional way of
     creating art never appealed to me. It was almost a bit too open ended 
     for me and if I made mistake, it often meant I would have to start over
     as arcylic paint is not the most forgiving medium. Web design on the other
     hand is quite the oppsite. One can simply remove a line of code or go back
     to an older version of the site to undo any mistakes. It is a more forgiving 
     process in that aspect. It also mixes coding into the mix that makes it a 
     more modern art form. Being in my early 20s this is an undienable plus since it 
     makes me feel like my work can be appercaited by my peers and has real utility 
     to it. 
     <br> <br>
     The second passion of mine is less techinally driven interest. Taking ecology 
     and biology classes in high school made me look at the natrual world with a 
     more critical eye. Instead of thinking an animal looked odd or bazzar, I 
     started to wonder why they looked the way they did and if it was the 
     environment or its place in the food chain. As I got older this curisoity 
     turned to why humans are the way we are and our evolutionary journey and its 
     place in the current time period. As more information closly gets uncovered and 
     piece of our past has been put together it really presents an intriguing story 
     of where we came from as a speicies. Learning about this kind of science has 
     really helped me put things into perspective and feel more connected with the 
     world. I know these are quite __ statements but I think someone's passion/hobby 
     should help people feel more present and connected to their spot in the world 
     and for me, learning about "life's" past does that for me. 
     <br> <br>
     On a lighter note if you ever learn more about bugs, you'll find that they truly 
     are the aliens that roam along side us!
