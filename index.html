    <h3> About Me </h3>
    
    <p class="centeredp"> I am 21 year old student living in Boston. I orginally 
     am from Illinois in the ChicagoLand area. 
     - stuff that happened in the last year/ what I want to do in the future

    <h3> Life synompis</h3>
  
    <p>
     I was born in Hunan China and adopted at the age of three and a half. 
     Due to speaking some chinese as a child my parents where keen on 
     making sure I did not loose that skill. At 21 years old now my listening 
     comprehension is near fulent with my other three skills leaving a bit to
     be desired as I have had little practice since high school. Growing up I
     was fortunate to be exposed to many different activies from art classes 
     to chinese dancing to tennis lessons. These experince taught me how to 
     learn different types of skills and knowing how I learn best as an 
     individual. 
     <br> <br>
     At age 12 my mother passed away from heart cancer. This had a huge impact 
     on my life as she was my main care taker. Soon after her passing my father 
     started a six year traveling mania. Every break I had during middle school 
     and high school, he would take me on eye opening vacations where we travled 
     the world. Seeing what other people live through and what their normal life 
     routine are made me truly value the life I had. During this time I was drawn
     to Japanese animation to the point it led me to taking Japanese language classes
     at the local community college COD. I made decent progress during that one
     semester and can say that learning languages is a low-key hobby of mine but it
     is hard to self teach a language with no one to practice with. 
     <br> <br>
     After graduating high school with honors I moved to Boston to attend Simmons 
     University. I originally chose this school as I thought an all women learning 
     envirnment would be the best way to start my higher education career since 
     computer science is a male dominated field. After the first year this turned out 
     not to be the case so I took the down time during COVID-19 to sit down and ask 
     myself what I wanted my future to look like. I realized that sitting down and 
     coding all day was not a long term goal. The idea of a dual major popped in my head. 
     With that in mind I searched for a school in the area that offered that type of 
     schooling. That is when I stumbled Northeastern University. It was a perfect match 
     for both location and academic excellence so I applied immediately and was elated 
     to be accepted as a transfer student. I am now in the third year and have really
     enjoyed my time at the university. ..... <br>

    <h3> Passions </h3>
    <p> 
     As I have entered the young adult stage of my life there where two 
     distinct topics that really drew my attention. The first being web 
     development/design and the second one being evolution. I will go into
     more detail as to what excatly makes those two very different interest 
     become my passion. 
     <br> <br>
     I hope the layout and small details of this website (when finished) 
     can in part show that web development is something I am truly 
     passionate about.
     <br> <br>
     Both my grandmother and mother have been very artisitic and distilled 
     it's value in me when I was younger. At that time the more traditional 
     way of creating art never appealed to me. It was almost a bit too open 
     ended for me and if I made mistake, it often meant I would have to start 
     over as arcylic paint is not the most forgiving medium. Web design on the 
     other hand is quite the oppsite. One can simply remove a line of code or 
     go back to an older version of the site to undo any mistakes. It is a more 
     forgiving process in that aspect. It also mixes coding into the mix that 
     more modern art form. Being in my early 20s this is an undienable plus 
     since it makes me feel like my work can be appercaited by my peers and has 
     real utility to it. 
     <br> <br>
     The second passion of mine is less techinally driven interest. Taking 
     ecology and biology classes in high school made me look at the natrual 
     world with a more critical eye. Instead of thinking an animal looked 
     odd or bazzar, I started to wonder why they looked the way they did and 
     if it was the environment or its place in the food chain. As I got older 
     this curisoity turned to why humans are the way we are and our evolutionary 
     journey and its place in the current time period. As more information closly 
     gets uncovered and piece of our past has been put together it really presents 
     an intriguing story of where we came from as a speicies. Learning about this 
     kind of science has really helped me put things into perspective and feel more 
     connected with the world. I know these are quite __ statements but I think 
     someone's passion/hobby should help people feel more present and connected to 
     their spot in the world and for me, learning about "life's" past does that 
     for me. On a lighter note if you ever learn more about bugs, you'll find that 
     they truly are the aliens that roam along side us!
