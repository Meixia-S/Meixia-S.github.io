        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> A fun marble solitaire game with three different board shapes to chose from. 
            <br> The shapes are English, European, and Triangle. If you would like to play a 
            <br> game, simply download the code and create a configuration. The format  
            <br> should be (board shapre, , ,). 
            <br> This was made with the view, model, and controller set up. The view only 
            <br> deals with what the view sees (ie the user interface), while the controller 
            <br> deals with processing user input, and the model handles the game logic and 
            <br> functions. This keeps the code very easy to read and to edit in the future.

        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> This is a image processor program that allows you load, edit, and save 
            <br> images (supports: jpg, png, bmp, ppm3). There are three different ways to 
            <br> use the program: 1. through the shell via text commands
            <br> <p class= "indent">
                                  2. through the terminal/scripts
            <br>                  3. the GUI (recommended) </p>
            <br> For more information about the inner workings of the program please read
            <br> the README provided. The file will give a more detailed explanation about 
            <br> why I designed the program in the format that I did and how to use it. 
            <br> Unlike the previous project mentioned above, this assignment was more open
            <br> ended as students had more freedom over the design. The only requirements 
            <br> where to make sure that all the features where working as intended.

        <td> China's Economy <br> <em> Macroeconomics </em> </td>
        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> This project focus was to research another country's macro economy, convert 
            <br> data into graphs, and analize those graphs to determine the strenghts and 
            <br> weaknesses of their ecnomy. This project was done in stages during the 
            <br> entire semester and at the end we needed to present our findinds to the 
            <br> class. Due to the fact I took the course during COVID, the presentation is 
            <br> a prerecorded video. My role in this project was the 'leader' as I consistently 
            <br> organized team meetings, created the graphs, made the powerpoint, and edited 
            <br> the video.
