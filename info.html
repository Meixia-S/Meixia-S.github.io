        <td> <p> A fun marble solitaire game with three different board shapes to chose from. 
            <br> This was made with the view, model, and controller set up. The view only 
            <br> deals with what the view sees (ie the user interface), while the controller 
            <br> deals with processing user input, and the model handles the game logic and 
            <br> functions. This keeps the code very easy to read and to edit in the future.

        <td> Image Processor </td>
        <td> <p> A fun marble solitaire game with three different board shapes to chose from. 
            <br> This is a image processor program that allows you load, edit, and save 
            <br> images (supports: jpg, png, bmp, ppm3). There are three different ways to 
            <br> use the program: 1. through the shell via text commands
            <br class= "spacing1"> 2. through the terminal/scripts
            <br class= "spacing2"> 3. the GUI (recommended)
            <br> For more information about the inner workings of the program please read the
            <br> README provided. The file will give a more detailed explanation about why I 
            <br> designed the program in the format that I did and how to use it. 
            <br> Unlike the previous project mentioned above, this assignment was more open
            <br> ended as students had more freedom over the design. The only requirements 
            <br> where to make sure that all the features where working as intended.
