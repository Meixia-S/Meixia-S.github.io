        <td> Marble Solitaire <br> <em> Object Oriented Design </em> </td>
        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> A fun marble solitaire game with three different board shapes to chose from. 
            <br> The shapes are English, European, and Triangle. If you would like to play a 
            <br> game, simply clone the repository and create a configuration. The format  
            <br> should be (board shapre, , ,). 
            <br> This was made with the view, model, and controller set up. The view only 
            <br> deals with what the view sees (ie the user interface), while the controller 
            <br> houses and processes user input, and the model handles the game logic and 
            <br> functions. This keeps the code very easy to read and to edit in the future. 
            <br> If you are an employer and would like futher detail feel free to contact me
            <br> since this program was not as explicit with the game design and directions.

        <td> Image Processor <br> <em> Object Oriented Design </em> </td>
        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> This is a image processor program that allows you load, edit, and save 
            <br> images (supports: jpg, png, bmp, ppm3). There are three different ways to 
            <br> use the program: 
            <p class= "indent">
                                  1. through the shell via text commands
            <br>                  2. through the terminal/scripts
            <br>                  3. the GUI (recommended) </p>
                 For more information about the inner workings of the program please read
            <br> the README provided. The file will give a more detailed explanation about 
            <br> why I designed the program in the format that I did and how to use it. 
            <br> Unlike the previous project mentioned above, this assignment was more open
            <br> ended as students had more freedom over the design. The only requirements 
            <br> where to make sure that all the features where working as intended. If you
            <br> would like to use the processor you can clone the respoitory. I highly 
            <br> suggest that you throughly read the README file in the 'info' folder. The 
            <br> program has a restrictive naming convention for saving image when using 
            <br> the GUI. Let me know if you are having any issues. 
            <br> *This was partially a group effort project

        <td> Country's Economy <br> <em> Macroeconomics </em> </td>
        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> This project focus was to research another country's macro-economy, convert 
            <br> data into graphs, and analize those graphs to determine the strenghts and 
            <br> weaknesses of their ecnomy. This project was done in stages during the entire
            <br> semester and at the end we needed to present our findings to the class. Due 
            <br> to the fact I took the course during COVID, the presentation is a prerecorded
            <br> video. For my group we chose to reseach China. My role in this project was
            <br> the 'leader' as I consistently organized team meetings, created the graphs, 
            <br> made the powerpoint, and edited the video. This experince gave me some
            <br> practice in dealing with a language barrier and  working with people in
            <br> drastically different time zones.

        <td> Chain Expansion <br> <em> International Business </em> </td>
        <td class= "paragraph"> 
             <p> The goal of this project is to determine weather or not a given American 
            <br> chain creating a international branch in a foreign country would be an 
            <br> lucrative endeavor. We had to research the different factors that would
            <br> play a role in the success of this project. Some examples are the current
            <br> trends regarding eating habits, the country's resources, infrastructure, 
            <br> and the cost of building a new location as well as upkeep. The chain my
            <br> group chose was Panera and the forgien country is Brazil. By the end of the
            <br> researching phase we concluded that it would be a financally stable move
            <br> since the demographic was going towards healthier eating and the rescources 
            <br> needed are present. The role I played in this project is similar to the 
            <br> previous one with the only difference was having one other teammate who
            <br> would help me with research and communicating with other members.
